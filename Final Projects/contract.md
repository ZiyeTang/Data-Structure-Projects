# team contract
## Communication

### Team Meetings
All members should send their emails and upload a copy of their class schedule to the respective discord channels. The meeting leadear should send out a @everyone ping before the meeting. Matt will record the meetings and post them to the discord.
Meeting times are Tuesday @ 3, Thursday @ 8. At least attend the Tuesday meeting.

### Assistance
All communication will be done over the discord channel, and emails can be sent in an emergency. Members should respond at least by the end of the day if contacted before 8, excluding Friday and Saturday and emergencies.

### Respect
Every week someone leads the Tuesday meeting (Thursdays are informal), starting with Matt, then Ajata, James, and Tommy. The meeting leader will be responsible for making sure everyone has the chance to share their thoughts and nobody's opinions go unheard.
No question is too dumb!

## Collaboration
### Work Distribution
Work Distribution will be managed with GitHub projects. At every Tuesday meeting, the meeting leader will check in with each member on their progress towards their tasks. Tasks will be drafted and further discussed in the first meeting possible.

If making a push to the repo, the member should tell the #commits discord channel.

### Time Commitment
Each member should work on this project every week with a minimum of 2 and a half hours (with the possible exception of the first few weeks).

### Conflict Resolution
Conflicts should try to be solved internally first. If needed, a meeting will be set up and both sides will have an allocated time to explain their circumstances. If the conflict can't be resolved, the mentor should be alerted.
