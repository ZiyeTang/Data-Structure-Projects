Implement multiple data structures and solve practical problems with them.</br>
- Achieved image rotation by swapping pixels, which are objects stored in a 2D array.</br>
- Achieved image modification such as scaling, desaturation, lightening, darkening, and grayscaling by changing attributes of each pixel like hue, transparency, and saturation. Adding stickers to an image in a given
position by replacing pixels of the base image by the sticker image's pixels.</br>
- Implemented a linked list class with functions such as destroy, insert front, insert back, split, reverse, merge, and rotate, etc.</br>
- Created a mosaic image given an original image and a bunch of other images as tiles by implementing a K-d Tree.</br>
- Traverse pixels in an image using DFS and BFS. Flood-fill the image in each type of traversal.</br>
- Implemented functions of disjoint set, such as find the representative of a set, union two sets, get the size of a set, etc. Randomly generate a maze by randomly removing walls, which is achieved by merging two disjoint
sets.Solved randomly generated maze using DFS.</br>
- Created a graph using Netflix data. Assign each cast member a vertex, and connect two cast members with an edge if they have worked on the same movie or TV show. Implemented functions to find shortest path between two actors/directors using BFS of graph. Implement functions to
find all paths between two actors or directors. Implemented functions to traverse all actors and directors.</br>
